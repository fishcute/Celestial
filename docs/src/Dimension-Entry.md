Dimensions can be registered in [`dimensions.json`](https://github.com/fishcute/Celestial/wiki/JSON-Files#dimensionsjson)

***

Registered dimensions must have a folder in `assets\celestial\sky` named after the dimension's in-game id.

_For example: The overworld would be registered as `overworld`, and the end would be registered as `the_end`._

***

Registering modded dimensions is supported.
